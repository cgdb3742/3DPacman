# 3DPacman
A 3D Pacman using openGL

This project was created while I was learning openGL.
It was originally intended to be a multiplayer (1 Pacman vs 4 ghosts) game based on the original Pacman game, but I currently lack the time and energy to finish it.
It is still playable as a solo game in its current state.
Left and right keys to turn, down to do a half-turn.
Edit the call to LoadMaps() in GameMap constructor to play on other maps.
